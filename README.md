# Final-Year-Project

This is my final year project for IMAT3903 
This is my QT Pharmacy System 

This system gives you the ability of buying drugs. 

It has an Admin who is responsible of the system. There is a Pharmacist who is responsibl for adding new patients, updating existing 
patients as well as deleting patients. 
The pharmaicst has many different responsiblities as she/he the main character of my system. 
Pharmacist can also add new drugs, updating drugs and deleting them. Patients have the ability of placing orders and pharmacist can be 
able of viewing them. So both can access them. 


A key feature of my system is that it's a friendly user and it can be used by users who are registered by the NHS and have a valid 
prescription from their consultant. 

A very important is that Consultants can be added or updated on my system so that the pahrmacist can't delete them. 

My tem is easy to use as well as it has a help form so that it makes it much easier to you to understand and try it. 


Hope you will enjoy using my sysyem :)))
